Fairness in AI: Resume Bias

The aim was to explore the effects of bias on the job application process and evaluating the overall fairness of a variety of models. 
This was a project that I undertook with guidance from student coordinators, and there were a total of 4 collab notebooks to guide me through this. 

A total of 4 collab notebooks were uploaded:

Conscientious Cars 1&2 : In this notebook, the aim was to create an algorithm that could recognize dogs. I explored how the CNN function was used and the basics of machine learning.
